~ Authentication of incoming requests to the Ansible Service Broker

Clients of the ASB:
    * Service Catalog
        - For normal operations, Service Catalog is the only entity which will be
          authorized to send requests to the broker
    * Developer Tooling
        - An APB author may want to use the apb tool to update the reference of
          APB specs in Broker to test local APBs. These use specially configured
          routes.

Authentication Mechanisms:
 * BasicAuth is currently implemented in the service broker code;
    1. A secret is created in the broker namespace containing the username/password
    2. A broker resource is created and sets "basic" referencing prior to created
       secret.
    3. The Service Catalog sends Basic Auth info on each request and the broker
       validates the request based on the secret.
 * Bearer Token
    * Shared Secret methods;
      1. A service account is created purely for authentication purposes, ie.
         'sb-auth-sa'. Alternately, use the Kube SA token secret for the SA
         associated with the broker.
      2. A secret is created in the broker's namespace with the desired SA token.
      3. A broker resource is created and sets the secret reference for "bearer"
      4. The service catalog sends Bearer Token Auth and the broker validates
         based on the secret.
    * Delegated Authentication workflow;
      1. The broker registers an endpoint and integrates with the aggregated API
         server.
      2. A role is defined with the desired permissions for accessing the endpoint
         resource.
      3. A service account is created and granted the previous role.
      4. A secret is created with the SA token.
      5. A broker resource is created referencing the secret.
      6. The Service Catalog uses the token from the secret in its requests.
      7. The API server is then in charge of enforcing policy wrt requests being
         allowed on the endpoint. The broker does not do authn/authz itself.
         ?. Is this Bearer Token value in the request from the service catalog
            using the token from the secret or Service Catalog's own SA token?

TLS:
* Ansible Service Broker uses a SSL cert injected as a secret from:
  https://docs.openshift.com/online/dev_guide/secrets.html#service-serving-certificate-secrets
* Example of OpenShift Template deploying ASB and how it is using the
  Service Serving Certificate Secrets:
  https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/blob/master/templates/deploy-ansible-service-broker.template.yaml#L14
* openshift-ansible based installs will be updated in 3.7 to do similar (not yet done):
